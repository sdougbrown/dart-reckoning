# Dart Reckoning

An experiment in porting some of the more useful bits from [ReckoningJS](https://github.com/sdougbrown/reckoning).

This lib is presently focused on date parsing and range mapping - some of the other bits like locales and displaying calendars are outside scope at the moment.  (That may change in time.)
