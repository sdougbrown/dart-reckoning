# Dart Reckoning

An experiment in porting some of the more useful bits from [ReckoningJS](https://github.com/sdougbrown/reckoning).

This lib is presently focused on date parsing and range mapping - some of the other bits like locales and displaying calendars are outside scope at the moment.  (That may change in time.)

The nice thing about Dart is that dates are much easier to work with out of the box, so this lib can be much more focused...
